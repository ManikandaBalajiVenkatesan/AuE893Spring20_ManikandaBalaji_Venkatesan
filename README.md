I am Manikanda Balaji Venkatesan Graduate student at CU ICAR. I am interested in working on developing mobility solutions for autonomous vehicles. I have previously worked in developing control algorithm and mathematical models for developing emission control system to meet Bharat Stage 6 emission norms.
This repository is for uploading assignment and project codes in Autonomy Science & Systems course.
