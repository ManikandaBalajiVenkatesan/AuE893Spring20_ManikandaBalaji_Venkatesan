I am Manikanda Balaji Venkatesan Graduate student at CU ICAR. I completed my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from SSN College of Engineering, Chennai, India. After my graduation I went on to work for Ashok Leyland in control systems team of Engine R&D. I was invloved in developing control algorithm and mathematical models as part of emission control system development to meet Bharat Stage 6 emission norms. I am interested in developing mobility solutions for autonomous vehicles that would accelerate the realization of complete autonomous shared mobility system on road successfully.
